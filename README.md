# Web-Vulnerability-Scanner

Original Work Set-up & Completion Summary

Objective/Purpose:

When I first got into cybersecurity, I found there were two main kinds of attacks: web based and system based attacks. After doing more research, I realized that there is a lot of opportunity to work with web based attacks and started formulating ways on how I could work with. This idea also stemmed from discussions with cybersecurity professionals.
The way data is transferred and handled between clients and websites should be more secure, however many are still unaware of the risks that exist. The purpose of my original work is to assist website creators and owners in identifying certain common web vulnerabilities. Sql database, php and html code, and unchecked back ups of code, are vulnerable to sql injections, xss scripting, malware insertions and more.  If such vulnerabilities are detected, web based attacks can be prevented if the owner of the site modifies the program to sanitize user input and patch the vulnerabilities. In addition to that, I also want to notify the user if the right protocol is being used to prevent the user from submitting unencrypted sensitive data to certain websites. 

Methodology:

Materials: 
I mainly used the Eclipse integrated development environment to create my program. With over 800 lines of code, I developed the user interface and functionality of the program. In addition, I used the xampp web server to host the databases and web pages. Notepad++ was used as the development environment for the html and php code.
Procedures: 
After first researching all the different possible attacks, I saw that there were system-based and web-based attacks. For my project, I decided to focus on web-based attacks and looked into how I can demonstrate it. I used Java to program the web vulnerability scanner on the eclipse IDE. In the first part of my original work, I needed to create a site that was vulnerable to XSS and SQL scripting. I did this by downloading the xampp server and creating two web pages with html. The first web page is a user registration form. This allowed the user to register themselves and create a database entries. Then with either the input of malicious SQL input or username/password a user is able to login. With a combination of tutorial guidance and added creativity, I designed the webpage to meet the needs of my web app vulnerability scanner. The second web page I created was a comments page. For this page, I first created the textbox that would take user input and created the corresponding database for that input. I additionally then added a comments section that would print out the user’s comments and store those comments in database. To do this, I first created the html file that outlined the webpage and then included the php file for the functionality.
After this first part, I started working on the actual program. With the use of the eclipse IDE, I used Java to program my original work. I created the owner of the site section first. This portion of the web vulnerability scanner would take user input and examine the web server code for sql injection, xss scripting, denial of service, or malware insertion vulnerabilities. For sql injection, I included a series of steps that the owner can follow to self validate if his or her site can be hacked with sql injections. For the xss scripting portion, I automated the program to open up the link, maliciously enter the code that was cause xss scripting, and cause the comments box to print a line that indicated occurred. I then examined the html code of the page and notified the user if xss scripting actually occurred. After this section was completed, I added a section that asked a few questions to see if the site is vulnerable to denial of service attacks. Since most sites are vulnerable to such attacks, this section required little input from the user. Finally, I added the malware checker. This scans two different backups of code and notifies the user of any changes.
	Another small section I added was the user security section. This takes input from the user and decides if the url is secure or not based on the protocol it has at the beginning of the url. 
	To make this easier for the user of the program, I created a guide that would let the user of the program know what vulnerabilities and attacks are possible and how they can be prevented. For this guide, I first had to research every web attack that I mentioned or use in my program. Then I created this guide that explained the background, attack, and preventive measures for each of the attacks. This guide is informative on the attacks and allows me to directly demonstrate my understanding of web attacks and cybersecurity in general. The final steps of the original work included repeated testing, documentation, and compiling pictures and videos to show my original work.

Utilization of Higher-Level Thinking Skills:

My original work required designing and planning skills since the presentable portion of it was based on user interface. I had to design an application layout that smoothly transitioned from one frame to another and keep a consistent layout between each section of the scanner. More significantly, I chose and organized the images, layout, and registration/comment web pages of my experimental test website. I used HTML to design the web pages on the web server.
	In addition to designing, most or my original work required the construction of a program. I had to program all the buttons to perform their actions when clicked, make the choosing of options a reliable feature, and make the functionality of the code and URL scanning. Construction was the basis for my entire original work since I had to program every line from scratch with minimal guidance.
	Creating the program mainly required logical thinking since I had to figure out how to perform the tasks I intended to program. I encountered challenges such as accessing the localhost server from the java program or scanning the html code of the site. And challenges such as these require careful evaluation for the code (line by line) in addition to many modifications. I specifically had to figure out how to automate xss scripting, get the html code, and scan the html code without the program throwing an error. Instead of conducting pure research and compiling information, I had to apply my research in different ways while considering its real world applications.
As mentioned before, I encountered many errors and bugs in my program. To overcome such challenging, I frequently had to analyze my lines of code and take advantage of online forums and videos to overcome such obstacles.

Results:

I was able to successfully create a prototype of the end program I had envisioned. I successfully completed all three desired components: the application, the web server and databases, and the user guide to web attacks. I enjoyed doing extensive research on the overall project and my program serves the desired purpose of scanning vulnerabilities. The main goals were to automate xss scripting on a web application, perform sql injection, scan a program for potential changes, and evaluate if a website was vulnerable to a denial of service attack. My program was able to automate xss scripting and notify the user of the program if it successfully occured. The XSS script was injected into my comments webpage and returned the result that was injected. I was also able to successfully perform sql injection on the test. For the malicious changes scanning portion of the web application scanner, I gave multiple inputs with 0, 10, and 35 character changes. The program successfully recognized those numbers and printed them back. The denial of service questions responded to denial of service only being possible if both questions were answered with “yes”. The https protocol scanning part scanned the url for the protocol.  
I created web pages with HTML that are hosted on a web server. I created a webpage that can register a user and a user can log in. I also created a second webpage called a comments page. This page allows for the user to create comments that will be displayed back to the user.  My program scans webpages and applications for vulnerability and concludes if it is vulnerable to a certain attack. The vulnerabilities (or common attacks that could occur) it tests for are SQL injection, XSS scripting, Denial of Service, and malware/database modification check. With this I am able to demonstrate sql injection and xss scripting.



Conclusions/Interpretations:  

I enjoyed doing research on the topic and look forward to showing what I have done to my future mentor. Currently, there are many developed applications and older, less secure websites that have many vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited. The results of my original work were as expected since I created the program and designed how and what should happen. Although there is little to quantify since all the results were a direct result of my what I had done, I am satisfied with the way my original work project turned out and hope that with more development and refinement it can be tested on bigger and real websites. From a bigger perspective, it still somewhat limited right now however, if I potentially pursue it as a final product idea or a general project to complete later on, it has great capabilities to easily expand into something that is much larger.




Application/Meaning:  

My original work can be used mainly by developers and web users in general. Developers can use my work to penetration test their own web applications and follow up with any discovered vulnerabilities by following the guide I have also created. This product can also be used by common consumers in that it can be used to check the protocol of the URL. Overall, the program I have created will be more suited for new developers and people who are unaware of cybersecurity. The guide I have created can also help in educating the world about this aspect about cybersecurity. I have learned a lot about the inner workings of web applications and cybersecurity on the internet. I truly enjoyed making this original work and feel that I have gained a higher understanding in cybersecurity.
